### Packet abomination [100p]
we have to extract the hash here, after doing a simple attempt i got a hash but it wasn't what we want
```
root@DESKTOP-NS9V6J9:~# strings Packet-abomination.pcap | grep -e "[0-9a-f]\{32\}" -w  -o | sort -u
632e1c9b593b0faf778e6de166448d93
```
so i looked again and i found this weird sort of strings
```
root@DESKTOP-NS9V6J9:~# strings Packet-abomination.pcap | tail

```
I opened wireshark and searched for ``` lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll0 ``` string to find 32 unknown packets, which was interesting because the length of the md5 hashes is 32 too, so I filtered and sorted them and I took each char at the end then combiend them together to get the flag
